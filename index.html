		<title>Locating Mary Berg's Diary</title>

		<meta name="description" content="Summarization of the major issues in historicizing and mapping the locatable content in 'Warsaw Ghetto: A Diary by Mary Berg', written by Mary Berg (Miriam Wattenberg) between 1939 and 1944, predominantly in the Warsaw Ghetto but revised, translated, and edited afterward in New York City. Mary Berg's youth and sharp eye for the importance of place make this diary continue to be a valuable historical and affective document when studying the Holocaust, despite being out of print in English for most of the second half of the 20th century.">

						Between these two photos, Miriam spent 342 days fleeing as a refugee from the German conquest of her country, 99 days restricted by diktat to a small portion of Warsaw because the Germans claimed area was "threatened by epidemics", 228 days watching the forced labor of her fellow Jews as they built the walls of their own Ghetto under the rifles of the Nazis and the German army, 608 days in cramped apartments inside the Ghetto, 186 days in a prison within the Ghetto on the knife edge of freedom and deportation to the death camps, and 412 days alternately travelling and waiting in scared uncertainty before she got to freedom in New York City.

					<h2>Why I'm Doing This</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/umschlagplatz_lg.png">
					<h3>To Show Both Time and Space in the Ghetto Experience</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						This project is a continuous work in progress. With it, I want to allow people to move around in the Warsaw ghetto with Miriam/Mary, to understand the differences in the periods of her life that I mentioned at the beginning.</p>
					<p>My hope is that at least some people using the site will have a greater appreciation for the day by day grind of life in the Warsaw Ghetto, for the fact that it wasn't merely a segregating experience but a terrorizing one over a personally long period of time. If we were to sit here in uncomfortable silence with just one minute for every day Miriam lived in fear of the Germans before reaching the United States, we'd be here for almost 27 hours.</p>
					<p>As well, I hope the essay will show her life and diary as both an important kind of resistance effort itself — in her daily affirmation of continued life in the Ghetto — as well as a documentation of many — and many kinds of — individual and group resistance efforts.
					</p>

					<h3>To Highlight the Value of Small Data in Digital Humanities Projects</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						I'm also interested here continuing the conversation about scale and data in Digital Humanities. I've tried to take a single book, by a single person (leaving aside the editorial process Miriam went through) and, in some senses, close-read it for historical data.
					</p>
					<p>Then I've re-presented that data in a way that I hope challenges site visitors to read her spatial experience in the Warsaw Ghetto painstakingly — not without some risk of collapsing time.</p>
					<p>
						I don't claim to have made something that will let site visitors empathize in a way that they wouldn't already. But I do hope to make a small contribution to this moment of transition, as we move inexorably away from living eyewitnesses to the Holocaust to secondary witnessing.

					<h3>Limits of Representation and the Representation of Limits</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						In the published papers of Saul Friedländer's touchstone 1990 conference, "Nazism and the 'Final Solution': Probing the Limits of Representation", Berel Lang turned the conference subtitle on its head, discussing as well how artists and others talk about limits in the Holocaust. In making this map the way I have, I've attempted to place the Warsaw Ghetto in a larger cartographic and interpretive context, to ask the question of how to represent Miriam Wattenberg's limits but also her possibilities. Looking at the apparent confinement and hard lines of the map doesn't tell you how much fun she had singing with her friends, but reading the diary doesn't always show you how restricted her life space was.</p>
						<p>Despite Miriam Wattenberg's family's escape from the death camps, I've tried to avoid a redemptive narrative or really any teleology and to emphasize uncertainty and the possible bewilderment faced by someone living in the Ghetto or even in looking back on that life. Indeed, not long after Samuel L. Shneiderman helped along the revision, translation, and publication of her diary, Mary Berg withdrew from any association with the published object and with public identification as a Holocaust survivor. So much so that the photos I showed at the beginning of this presentation were bought at a yard sale and donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p>

					<h3>What I Think I've Found</h3>
					<p>
						<img alt="All mentioned places in Warsaw" src="img/all-warsaw-places.png" style="border:0; width:75%;">
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						One of the things I think I've found is a story of a certain kind of spatial privilege in the Warsaw Ghetto. A thoroughly relative and polyvalent privilege, but privilege just the same. This picture shows the addresses mentioned in the diary in and around what would become or was the Ghetto. Miriam Wattenberg hung out at a café, went to school, performed in a play, walked the streets. She didn't spend all day in a factory, cleaning houses, or smuggling across the Ghetto boundary. Most crucially, she never appears at the Umschlagplatz (memorialized in the photo background to this and other slides), the plaza in front of the train station used to send Jews to the extermination camps.</p>
						<p>
						Of the four places outside the Ghetto boundary, 2 are from after the official closure and all four are directly connected with escaping the Nazi death machine. One represents two of her friends who got forged passports from an unnamed "South American republic" and three are tied to her mother's American citizenship and its role in helping the family survive and escape.</p>
						<p>
							It's not the only kind of spatial privilege enjoyed by some in the Ghetto. Janina Bauman remembers in her autobiography working with the Toporol, a youth organization that planted gardens, cleared rubble, and even worked farms outside the city and smuggled extra food back in. None of that made a difference to the nearly 400,000 people the Germans killed directly or indirectly, quickly or slowly, individually or in groups, but these are important stories to be told and people to be remembered as whole people.
						</p>
						<p>
							We don't know what forever looks like in the digital world or the post-eyewitness world, but I hope that this project will keep alive one story of the Warsaw Ghetto a little while longer so that I can help others remember not to forget.
