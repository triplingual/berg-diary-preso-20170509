		<title>Locating Mary Berg's Diary</title>

		<meta name="description" content="Summarization of the major issues in historicizing and mapping the locatable content in 'Warsaw Ghetto: A Diary by Mary Berg', written by Mary Berg (Miriam Wattenberg) between 1939 and 1944, predominantly in the Warsaw Ghetto but revised, translated, and edited afterward in New York City. Mary Berg's youth and sharp eye for the importance of place make this diary continue to be a valuable historical and affective document when studying the Holocaust, despite being out of print in English for most of the second half of the 20th century.">

						Between these two photos, Miriam spent 342 days fleeing as a refugee from the German conquest of her country, 99 days restricted by diktat to a small portion of Warsaw because the Germans claimed area was "threatened by epidemics", 228 days watching the forced labor of her fellow Jews as they built the walls of their own Ghetto under the rifles of the Nazis and the German army, 608 days in cramped apartments inside the Ghetto, 186 days in a prison within the Ghetto on the knife edge of freedom and deportation to the death camps, and 412 days alternately travelling and waiting in scared uncertainty before she got to freedom in New York City.

							I add locatable references using geojson.io, with a 1930 map of Warsaw to guide me. I had to make reference also to current maps as well as to other historical maps, including (awkwardly) an unauthorized and poorly done digitization of one of the remarkable maps in Barbara Engelking-Boni and Jacek Leociak's "Warsaw Ghetto: A Guide to the Perished City".

					<h2>Why I'm Doing This</h2>

				<section data-background="img/umschlagplatz_lg.png">
					<h3>To Show Both Time and Space in the Ghetto Experience</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						When this is all done, my hope is that at least some people using the site will have a greater appreciation for the day-to-day grind of the Warsaw Ghetto, for the fact that it wasn't merely a segregating experience but a terrorizing one over a long period of time.
					</p>
					<p>
						As well, I hope the essay will show Berg's life and diary as both an important kind of resistance effort as well as a documentation of other individual and group resistance efforts.

					<h3>To Highlight the Value of Small Data in Digital Humanities Projects</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						I'm also interested here continuing the conversation about scale in data and Digital Humanities. I've tried to take a single book, by a single person (leaving aside the editorial process Miriam went through) and, in some senses, close-reading it for historical data. Then I've re-presented that data in a way that I hope challenges site visitors to read her experiences in the Warsaw Ghetto painstakingly, though at the risk of collapsing time. I don't claim to have something that will let site visitors empathize in a way that they wouldn't already. But I do hope to make a small contribution to this moment of transition, when we are moving inexorably away from living eyewitnesses to the Holocaust to secondary witnessing.

					<h3>Limits of Representation and the Representation of Limits</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						In the published papers of Saul Friedländer's touchstone 1990 conference, "Nazism and the 'Final Solution': Probing the Limits of Representation", Berel Lang turned the conference subtitle on its head, discussing as well how artists and others talk about boundaries in the Holocaust. In making this map the way I have, I've attempted to place the Warsaw Ghetto in a larger cartographic and intepretive context, to ask the question of how to represent Miriam Wattenberg's limits but also her possibilities. Looking at the apparent confinement of the map doesn't tell you how much fun she had singing with her friends, but reading the diary doesn't always show you how restricted her life space was.
						
						Despite Miriam Wattenberg's family's escape from the death camps, I've tried to avoid a redemptive narrative or really any teleology and to emphasize uncertainty and the possible bewilderment faced by someone living in the Ghetto or even in looking back on that life. Indeed, later in life, Mary Berg withdrew from any association with her published diary and public identification as a Holocaust survivor. The photos I showed at the beginning of this presentation were bought at a yard sale and donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
